# Web Scraping IMDb website with R

This is the Final Project for `Web Scraping with R` course. As a source, I used [IMDb](https://www.imdb.com/) website. IMDb - Internet Movie Database  is an online database of information related to movies and ratings. I scraped the webpage of [Top 250 movies](https://www.imdb.com/chart/top/).
